# Usage: run_test.sh <setup script> <work dir> [emulator...] <test executable>
#
# Runs the optional setup script to build a scratch image in <work dir>, then
# runs the test executable with the image path as its first argument.
#
# If a check script exists next to the setup script (test_<name>.check.sh),
# it runs after the test succeeded, on the host, with the image path as $1.
# It verifies what lwext4 wrote with independent tools (e2fsck, debugfs);
# common/check.sh has helpers for that.
#
# <work dir> (tmp/tests/... in the worktree, see CMakeLists.txt) holds the
# test's disk images; it is deleted when the test finishes, passed or failed,
# unless LWEXT4_KEEP_TEST_IMAGES is set (to look at the images of a failure).
