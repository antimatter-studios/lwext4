# branch adds (tests/test_*.c that its base does not have) must
#
#   RED:   fail when built from the branch's tests/ against the base's
#          library (a test that does not even build against the base, e.g.
#          because it uses a new API, also counts as red), and
#   GREEN: pass on the branch head.
#
# A test that guards against over-correcting (e.g. valid filesystems must
# still mount) is expected to pass on the base as well; it declares that
# with a "red-green: guard" comment.

# Both builds use AddressSanitizer + UBSan, so memory errors count as
# failures.
